# Wordle in C

This project was a way for me to teach myself C and learn the basics of git and github. prior to this project, I've only had experience with Python and Java through my highschool and University courses.
This project will be a text-based replica of the popular game called Wordle.
Users will have 6 guesses to guess a 5 letter word.
